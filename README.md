## Happy Valentine's Day
- https://creative-exercise-keiraschoolcraft.vercel.app/
- I did the Canvas option.
- I referenced mostly the [W3 School's Canvas information](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp), but also found ideas on how to draw the hearts on several stack overflow pages.
- I had a lot of fun with this project! I don't celebrate Valentine's day because it's a fake commercial holiday, but I thought it was fun to have a theme. I used adobe colorwheel to generate a pretty color scheme.
